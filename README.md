## Here's what I did in project 2:

For both part A and part B, our strategy was basically exactly the same. The two of us would get on zoom and start a VSCode Live Share session, where we could discuss problems together and also write / edit code together. We didn't really split up the work problem by problem; we know each other well and have worked together many times so we have a pretty well-oiled and efficient way of tackling problems together at the same time. Most of the submissions to github will probably be from Srishti because she usually started the live shares (meaning the edits were mostly made on Srishti's local files and not Melody's) but we did every part together and put in the same amount of work.
